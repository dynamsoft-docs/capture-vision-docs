# EnhancerFeatures

Enumeration `EnhancerFeatures` indicates the advanced features of Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer.

- `Frame Filter`: The frame sharpness filter feature of DCE. By enabling this feature, the low-quality frame will be recognized and discarded automatically.
- `Sensor Control`: The sensor filter feature of DCE. By enabling this feature, the frames will be discarded automatically while the device is shaking.
- `Enhanced Focus`: The enhanced focus feature. DCE will support the camera in triggering auto-focus.
- `Fast Mode`: The fast mode of DCE. By enabling the fast mode, the frames will be cropped to speed up the following processing.
- `Auto Zoom`: The auto-zoom feature of DCE. By enabling this feature, the camera will automatically zoom in to the interest area.
