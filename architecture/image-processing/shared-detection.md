In this article, we'll discuss the special section - **Shared Detection**.

# Section 2.1 - Shared Detection

As discussed in ["Divide Tasks into Sections"](index.md#divide-tasks-into-sections), an image-processing task usually consists of three sections. The 2nd section is one of the following three

- Barcode Localization
- Text-line Localization
- Document Detection

Each of these three sections consists of multiple stages and they all start with the following identical stages:

1. Cropping: to crop out the regions of interest which are found by the previous section "Region Pre-detection". If no such region was found, return the original image as a whole.
2. Down-scaling: to down-scale a massive image.
3. Grayscaling: to convert a colour image to grayscale.
4. Transforming: to transform a grayscale image.
5. Enhancing: to improve the quality of a grayscale image.
6. Binarizing: to convert a grayscale image to black & white.
7. Texture-detecting: to detect texture on a binary image.
8. Texture-removing-1: to remove the texture of a grayscale image.
9. Texture-removing-2: to remove the texture of a binary image.
10. Text-zone-detecting: to find the exact locations of text zones.
11. Text-removing: to remove text from a binary image.

These 11 stages are grouped together with the name "Shared Detection".

Each section may contain several more detailed algorithmic stages, and in this article we discuss Section2 - Shared Detection.

## Section 2 - Shared Detection

There are many stages in Section 2 that can handle common image-related quandaries to ensure that the identified target features are clear and can be used properly in the next sections.

This section begins with an image((possibly from the cropped results of section1). Then there are some optional stages to convert the input image to a binary image. Whether and how these is all determined by the specific parameter configuration of the Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) template. Table 1 lists these parameters and their respective design intents.

As mentioned above, The focus of this section is to use some optional image-processing techniques to enhance image features for next sections. It is not essential for most common scenarios but would be helpful for some special cases.
